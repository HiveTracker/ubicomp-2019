abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Association for Computing Machinery. Positional tracking systems could hugely benefit a number of niches, including performance art, athletics, neuroscience, and medicine. Commercial solutions can precisely track a human inside a room with sub-millimetric precision. However, these systems can track only a few objects at a time; are too expensive to be easily accessible; and their controllers or trackers are too large and inaccurate for research or clinical use. We present a light and small wireless device that piggybacks on current commercial solutions to provide affordable, scalable, and highly accurate positional tracking. This device can be used to track small and precise human movements, to easily embed custom objects inside of a VR system, or to track freely moving subjects for research purposes.},

@article{Marquardt1963,
abstract = {Until recently, alternative doctors and healers used to employ alternative ways of making their alternative diagnoses such as electro-acupuncture, iridiscopy, plantar reflexology, live blood analysis, aura reading and bioresonance methods. Two recent papers report the emergence of unjustified diagnoses, resulting from clinical chemistry testing in commercial laboratories with an alternative philosophy and character. Dutch law considers medicine to be a profession for which no special knowledge is demanded. Even incorrect diagnostic procedures and the diagnosis of non-existent diseases by these laboratories is not illegal, in spite of the resulting detrimental effects to the health and the purse of patients. Some would consider the Dutch law in this respect too liberal.},
