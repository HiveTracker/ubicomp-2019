abstract = {Almost all VR multi-person applications have the requirement of reconstructing the whole-body motions in real-time in order to create deeper immersion. In fact, if we can ensure that the motion we reconstruct is natural, we can improve upon the comfort and number of wearing sensors at the cost of reconstruction precision because all users in VR are blindfolded. In this paper, we introduce a novel real-time motion reconstruction and recognition method in VR only using the positions and orientations of user's head and two hands. To reconstruct natural motions according to rare sensors, we divide the whole body into the upper body and the lower body. The upper body reconstruction algorithm based on inverse kinematics which is more accurate and the lower body based on animation blending which only needs a small number of prepared animations. Meanwhile, a natural action recognition algorithm based on neural network will run in need to detect the target motions we have trained. We show that our method can reconstruct various full-body motions, such as walking in any direction, jogging, jumping, crouching and turning. Our method has the ability to reconstruct natural human motions which can be used in almost all VR multiperson interactive applications. The configuration of sensors we attached on the head and hands is very popular in VR well-known devices, so the method can be easily integrated into off-the-shelf VR devices. {\textcopyright} 2016 ACM.},

abstract = {HTC Vive has been gaining attention as a cost-effective, off-the-shelf tracking system for collecting ground truth pose data. We assess this system's pose estimation through a series of controlled experiments where we show its precision to be in the millimeter magnitude and accuracy to range from millimeter to meter. We also show that Vive gives greater weight to inertial measurements in order to produce a smooth trajectory for virtual reality applications. Hence, the Vive's off the shelf algorithm is poorly suited for robotics applications such as measuring ground truth poses, where accuracy and repeatability are key. Therefore we introduce a new open-source tracking algorithm and calibration procedure for Vive which address these problems. We also show that our approach improves the pose estimation repeatability and accuracy by up to two orders of magnitude.},

@article{Marquardt1963,
abstract = {Until recently, alternative doctors and healers used to employ alternative ways of making their alternative diagnoses such as electro-acupuncture, iridiscopy, plantar reflexology, live blood analysis, aura reading and bioresonance methods. Two recent papers report the emergence of unjustified diagnoses, resulting from clinical chemistry testing in commercial laboratories with an alternative philosophy and character. Dutch law considers medicine to be a profession for which no special knowledge is demanded. Even incorrect diagnostic procedures and the diagnosis of non-existent diseases by these laboratories is not illegal, in spite of the resulting detrimental effects to the health and the purse of patients. Some would consider the Dutch law in this respect too liberal.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Association for Computing Machinery. Positional tracking systems could hugely benefit a number of niches, including performance art, athletics, neuroscience, and medicine. Commercial solutions can precisely track a human inside a room with sub-millimetric precision. However, these systems can track only a few objects at a time; are too expensive to be easily accessible; and their controllers or trackers are too large and inaccurate for research or clinical use. We present a light and small wireless device that piggybacks on current commercial solutions to provide affordable, scalable, and highly accurate positional tracking. This device can be used to track small and precise human movements, to easily embed custom objects inside of a VR system, or to track freely moving subjects for research purposes.},

@article{Whelan2016,
abstract = {We present a novel approach to real-time dense visual SLAM. Our system is capable of capturing comprehensive dense glob- ally consistent surfel-based maps of room scale environments and beyond explored using an RGB-D camera in an incremental online fashion, without pose graph optimisation or any post-processing steps. This is accomplished by using dense frame-to-model camera tracking and windowed surfel-based fusion coupled with frequent model refinement through non-rigid surface deformations. Our approach applies local model-to-model surface loop closure optimisations as often as possible to stay close to the mode of the map distribution, while utilising global loop closure to recover from arbitrary drift and maintain global consistency. In the spirit of improving map quality as well as tracking accuracy and robustness, we furthermore explore a novel approach to real-time discrete light source detection. This technique is capable of detecting numerous light sources in indoor environments in real-time as a user handheld camera explores the scene. Absolutely no prior information about the scene or number of light sources is required. By making a small set of simple assumptions about the appearance properties of the scene our method can incrementally estimate both the quantity and location of multiple light sources in the environment in an online fashion. Our results demonstrate that our technique functions well in many different environments and lighting configurations. We show that this enables (a) more realistic augmented reality (AR) rendering; (b) a richer understanding of the scene beyond pure geometry and; (c) more accurate and robust photometric tracking.},
