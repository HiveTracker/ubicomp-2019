abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Association for Computing Machinery. Positional tracking systems could hugely benefit a number of niches, including performance art, athletics, neuroscience, and medicine. Commercial solutions can precisely track a human inside a room with sub-millimetric precision. However, these systems can track only a few objects at a time; are too expensive to be easily accessible; and their controllers or trackers are too large and inaccurate for research or clinical use. We present a light and small wireless device that piggybacks on current commercial solutions to provide affordable, scalable, and highly accurate positional tracking. This device can be used to track small and precise human movements, to easily embed custom objects inside of a VR system, or to track freely moving subjects for research purposes.},
